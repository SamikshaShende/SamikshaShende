##Hi there, I'm Samiksha Shende

I’m a Data Science & AI Engineer with hands-on experience in machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and big data systems. Graduated my MSc in Data Science, AI & Digital Business in Germany, with prior professional experience in scalable data engineering and backend development.

I build intelligent systems end-to-end — from raw data processing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment — with a strong focus on reliability, interpretability, and real-world impact.

Over the past few years, I have:

• Built trustworthy AI systems using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with grounding and hallucination control  
• Developed deep learning models for healthcare signal classification and computer vision  
• Designed NLP pipelines for business intelligence and churn prediction  
• Worked on scalable ETL and analytics pipelines using PySpark and cloud data platforms  

I’m interested in solving applied AI problems in NLP, predictive analytics, and large-scale ML systems.

Currently exploring opportunities as a **Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer** where I can contribute to impactful AI-driven solutions.

My Core Competencies Include:

•⁠  ⁠Machine Learning model development & evaluation: 
  •⁠  ⁠Natural Language Preprocessing (Text Preprocessing, Transformer models, RAG) 
  •⁠  ⁠Deep Learning architectures: CNN, RNN, LSTM 
  •  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
  •  Model Evaluation & Optimization  
  •  Feature Engineering & Statistical Modeling 
•⁠  ⁠Big Data engineering with PySpark, Databricks, Snowflake
•⁠  ⁠Data analysis & visualisation using Pandas, NumPy, Power BI
•⁠  ⁠Cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP
•⁠  ⁠End-to-end ML workflow: EDA → Feature Engineering → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment
